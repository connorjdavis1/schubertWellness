# Purpose

This is a part of a larger project that employs corpus methods to examine the role of variability as a predictor of a composer’s state of health. The specific focus of this study is the effect of syphilis—broadly defined as unwellness—on Franz Schubert’s musical output. Measures of scale-degree, interval, and rhythmic variability, are used utilized a binomial logistic regression. Two musical features were significant (P<.01) at predicting the episodes of unwellness in the composer’s output, highlighting the link between biographical events and artistic output.

Daniel Shanahan is a co-author on this project.
